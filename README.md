    Airfoil Flap Mechanism Design Project
  </h1>
  <p> The objective of this project was to design a mechanism to deploy flaps for an aircraft. To simplify modelling, the model only included the wing and flaps. Engineering analysis was performed on a single-slotted 
    flap mechanism by incorporating engineering design techniques. The flap mechanism was analyzed at three different angles that include 0%, 50%, and 100% flaps. </p>&nbsp
  <p>
    The image below illustrates the deployment of 100% flaps.

  <p>
    The code provides a performance analysis of the aircraft, comparing parameters such as lift, drag, moment coefficients, and altitude.
